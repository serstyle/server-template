## Server Template

A server template with login register signout and profile route.

You just need to change WORKDIR /usr/src/server_template in Docker file to an other name and watch in docker-compose.yml if you already used it.


## What techs I used 

- Node Js and Express
- PostgreSQL and Redis as databases
- Docker and docker-compose for running the node js, postgres and redis container together
- JWT as token for securing route and let the user connect on the website
